# Auto Pocket Tagger

Use Google cloud's Natural Language Processing API to automatically analyze the webpage from articles saved in your Pocket list, derive tags/keywords based on the content of the page, and add tags to the articles in Pocket list for free.

> Pocket has suggested tags service for their paid premium plans. You can find more about it [here](https://help.getpocket.com/article/906-pocket-premium-suggested-tags). This still requires manual work of adding the tags to each article one-by-one. This package automates all of it for free.

## Features
- Uses [Python wrapper](https://github.com/tapanpandita/pocket) for [Pocket API](http://getpocket.com/api/docs) to retrieve articles in the `My List`
- Uses [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to scrape webpages
- Uses Google Cloud's [Natural Language Processing API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) to generate list of categories and entities from the content of the webpage
- Uses Pocket API to add tags to articles in your `My List`


## Usage

### Installation

#### Install published version from pypi
```shell
$ pip install pocket-tagger
```

#### Install latest version from git
```shell
$ pip install git+https://github.com/sanghviharshit/pocket-tagger
```


### Prerequisites
#### [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/quickstart)

This package relies on Google cloud natural language processing API, which requires billing enabled on your project.
You can find the quickstart instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/quickstart)
**Options:**
1. Create a service account and download the credentials file - https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/common/auth
```python
tagger = PocketTagger(gcloud_credentials_file="gcloud_credentials_file.json")
```
2. or Configure gloud locally - https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init
```python
tagger = PocketTagger()
```

#### [Pocket API](https://getpocket.com/developer/)

To fetch the articles list and add tags, you need a developer key from [here](https://getpocket.com/developer/)
Create a new Application with `modify` and `retrieve` permissions. Save the Consumer Key and Access Token.
```python
tagger = PocketTagger(consumer_key='your-consumer-key',
                access_token='your-access-token')
```

### [Examples](./examples)

```python
# Initialize PocketTagger with GCloud and Pocket API Credentials
tagger = PocketTagger(gcloud_credentials_file="gcloud_credentials_file.json",
                consumer_key='pocket-consumer-key',
                access_token='pocket-access-token')

# Check https://getpocket.com/developer/docs/v3/retrieve for additional list of options you can pass for retrieving pocket list
articles = tagger.get_articles_from_api(count=10, offset=10, detailType='complete')

# Alternatively you can load the articles from file if you saved them previously using save_articles_to_file
# articles = tagger.get_articles_from_file("20190621.json")
# Generate tags for each article
articles_with_tags = tagger.get_tags_for_articles(articles)

# Save the articles with tags to file. You can use this file to verify it looks good before running the final step to tag the articles.
tagger.save_articles_to_file(today.strftime('%Y%m%d-with-tags.json'), articles_with_tags)

# You can skip this step if you want to do a dry run. Verify the tags in the file we generated in the previous step.
tagger.add_tags_to_articles(articles_with_tags)
```

### Optional overrides
You can override the default thresholds for [entity](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/rest/v1/Entity
) salience and [category](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/rest/v1/ClassificationCategory) confidence

```python
thresholds = {
  'entity_salience_threshold': 0.7
  'category_confidence_threshold': 0.3
}
articles_with_tags = tagger.get_tags_for_articles(articles, thresholds)
```

## Sample

Sample output from running it for my 490 items long Pocket list
> `X` under Entities or Categories denotes the NLP client returned those as potential candidates, but we skipped them because it didn't meet the threshold. You can see the last line `Tags: abc, xyz` for list of tags pocket-tagger added for each URL.
